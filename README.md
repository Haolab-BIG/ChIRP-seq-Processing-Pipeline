# ChIRP-seq-Processing-Pipeline
This pipeline processes raw ChIRP-seq FASTQ data through sequential steps including adapter trimming, quality control, genome alignment, and peak calling. The workflow supports three input types: odd, even, and optional input control. Repeat-masked sequences are removed prior to alignment. Odd and even datasets are merged and then compared to the input control if available.

The workflow is fully containerized using Singularity, including all required tools and dependencies. With a single command, raw FASTQ data can be processed through trimming, quality control, alignment, merging, repeat removal, and peak calling in a reproducible manner. Input control is optional; if not provided, peak calling is performed on the merged ChIRP-seq dataset alone.

# Part I Workflow
Here stands an throughout workflow of data analysis.

# Part II Requirements
1.  **Recommended Specs**:

      * 8-core CPU
      * 24 GB RAM

2.  **Singularity**: Must be installed on your system. Below are the detailed steps for installing on an Ubuntu 22.0.4 system. For other operating systems, please refer to the official installation guide: [https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html)

      * **Step 1: Install System Dependencies**

        ```bash
        # Update package lists and install dependencies
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y \
            build-essential \
            libseccomp-dev \
			libfuse3-dev \
            pkg-config \
            squashfs-tools \
            cryptsetup \
            curl wget git
        ```

      * **Step 2: Install Go Language**

        ```bash
        # Download and install Go
        wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
        sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzvf go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
        rm go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz

        # Configure Go environment variables and apply them
        echo 'export GOPATH=${HOME}/go' >> ~/.bashrc
        echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:${PATH}:${GOPATH}/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```

      * **Step 3: Download, Build, and Install Singularity**

        ```bash
        # Note: The script navigates to /mnt/share/software. 
        # You can change this to your preferred directory for source code.
        cd /mnt/share/software

        # Download the Singularity CE source code
        wget https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/download/v4.0.1/singularity-ce-4.0.1.tar.gz

        # Extract the archive and clean up
        tar -xvzf singularity-ce-4.0.1.tar.gz
        rm singularity-ce-4.0.1.tar.gz
        cd singularity-ce-4.0.1

        # Configure the build
        ./mconfig

        # Build Singularity (this can be time-consuming)
        cd builddir
        make

        # Install Singularity to the system
        sudo make install
        ```

      * **Step 4: Verify the Installation**

        ```bash
        # Check the installed version
        singularity --version

        # Display help information
        singularity -h
        ```

3.  **snakemake**: Snakemake must be installed on your system and requires a Python 3 distribution.

      ```bash
      pip install snakemake
      ```
      
4.  **Reference Data**: A directory containing Bowtie2 indexes. Below are detailed steps for the human **hg38 genome**. For other reference genomes, download the corresponding files and replace paths as needed.

      * 4.1 Repeat Index

        ```bash
        # Set base directory
        basementdir=/mnt1/2.NAS2024/wutan/9.pipe/3.chrip-seq/basement_data
        cd $basementdir

        # Download repeats from UCSC Table Browser and move to $basementdir (as shown in followed picture)
        singularity exec --cleanenv ChIRPseq.sif gunzip $basementdir/repeats.hg38.fa.gz

        # Remove spaces from headers to avoid duplicate names
        singularity exec --cleanenv ChIRPseq.sif awk '/^>/{gsub(/ /,"_"); print; next} {print}' repeats.hg38.fa > repeats.hg38.unique.fa
        singularity exec --cleanenv ChIRPseq.sif rm repeats.hg38.fa
        
        # Build Bowtie2 index for repeats
        singularity exec --cleanenv ChIRPseq.sif mkdir -p ${basementdir}/hg38_repeats
        singularity exec --cleanenv ChIRPseq.sif bowtie2-build --threads 8 -f ${basementdir}/repeats.hg38.unique.fa ${basementdir}/hg38_repeats/bowtie2_index
        ```

   * **Output Interpretation**

      - **`*.repeats.stats`**
        - **Content**: Bowtie alignment summary when reads are mapped **to the repeat reference database**. Reports total reads processed, reads aligned to repeats (unique/multiple), unaligned reads, and overall alignment rate.

        - **Application**:  
          - Evaluates the **repeat-removal step**.  
          - **Desired outcome**: a **higher percentage of unmapped reads** indicates that most sequencing reads are *not* repeats and can proceed to genome alignment.  
          - Useful for checking repeat content and filtering efficiency; results were aggregated with **MultiQC**.

      - **`*.genome.stats`**

        - **Content**: Bowtie alignment summary when reads are mapped **to the reference genome**. Includes total reads processed, uniquely mapped reads, multi-mapped reads, unaligned reads, and overall alignment rate.
        - **Application**:
          - Assesses **final genome alignment quality**.  
          - **Desired outcome**: a **high proportion of uniquely mapped reads** reflects good library quality and accurate genome mapping.  
          - Helps identify low-quality libraries or alignment issues and were visualized with **MultiQC**.
          
          <img width="1589" height="508" alt="图片" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0120f2e6-1560-4035-9682-372ba1600d60" />

      - **`*.DeDup.bam`**

        - **Content**: This is the main alignment file in Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format. It contains all the sequencing reads and their mapping coordinates on the reference genome. This version has had duplicate reads (PCR duplicates) removed. For more information please refer to: https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bam.html.
        - **Application**: It's the primary evidence for read alignment and can be used for detailed inspection in genome browsers or for downstream analyses.

      - **`*.dedup.bam.bai`**

        - **Content**: This is the index file for the BAM file.
        - **Application**: It allows for fast random access to the BAM file, which is essential for visualization software (like IGV) to quickly load and display alignments for a specific genomic region without reading the entire file.

      - **`*.bw`**

        - **Content**: A BigWig file that represents the End-seq signal coverage across the genome. It shows the read density (how many reads cover each position) in a compressed format. For more information please refer to: https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bigWig.html
        - **Application**: Primarily used for visualization. You can load this file into a genome browser (e.g., IGV, UCSC Genome Browser) to see a "signal track" that shows gene expression levels visually across chromosomes.

      - **`*.dedup.bam.bai`**

        - **Content**: This is the index file for the BAM file.
        - **Application**: It allows for fast random access to the BAM file, which is essential for visualization software (like IGV) to quickly load and display alignments for a specific genomic region without reading the entire file.

      - **`*.flagstat.txt`**

        - **Content**: Contains alignment statistics generated by samtools flagstat after removing duplicate reads. It reports the total number of reads, mapped reads, properly paired reads, singletons, and the number of duplicate reads removed, providing a summary of the final, deduplicated BAM file.

      - **`*fingerprints.pdf`**

        - **Content**: PDF file generated by `plotFingerprint` showing the cumulative read coverage across the genome for each BAM file. It visualizes enrichment patterns and sequencing depth consistency among samples.
        - **Application**: In the fingerprint plot, a larger separation between treatment and control curves, indicates stronger enrichment and higher signal-to-noise ratio. Also, the fingerprint plot can help decide whether to call narrow peaks or broad peaks: Narrow peaks are appropriate when the signal is sharp and localized; Broad peaks are used when the signal spans wide genomic regions with diffuse enrichment, such as histone modifications.
